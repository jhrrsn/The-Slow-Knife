THE SLOW KNIFE

The Slow Knife is a game of wretched scoundrels and patient revenge for 2-4 players. It's inspired by stories like The Count of Monte Cristo, where a simple death is too good for all those years the villains took from their victim. This isn't a John Wick-style action flick, no—this is curt whispers over fine wine, jewelled masks of jade and bone, half-buried scandals and half-heard truths, and yes - sometimes - a quiet blade in the dark.

You'll establish a promising young soul who's life is ruined by a handful of grasping scoundrels, then you'll tell the decades-long story of the victim's overdue and inevitable vengeance. You'll tell this story from the perspective of the villains, with the protagonist - The Knife - moving in the shadows or behind disguises.

You'll answer card prompts about your villain's life as you add notes and connections to a pinboard of sin and scandal. These prompts are split into four acts to help guide your story to a satisfying conclusion. As you progress through these acts you'll also tell the story of The Knife as they rise from depraved captivity to high society and begin to enact their revenge.

By the end of the game you'll have constructed the conspiracy that destroys your wretched character as they find themselves broken and utterly ruined, face-to-face with The Knife for one last reckoning.

Then, as the sun rises on a land free of those avaricious scoundrels, you'll consider what solace - if any - The Knife might find for the rest of their days.

THE GAME

At the core of The Slow Knife is a 52-card deck of prompts that asks probing, establishing questions about your villainous characters and their dishonourable lives. You'll take turns answering from this deck, building out the story of your character as you pass through the years. After resolving each card, you'll consider the board in front of you and add cards and connections to reflect what you've added to the story.

The board is the other major component of the game. As you progress through the game your host of characters and events will swell—the board is how you record that information so you can maintain and complete story beats. It's also a really fun artefact of play, something you can imagine hanging on the wall of your single-minded protagonist.

By the time you reach the fourth and final act, you'll have a knotty web of cheap lies, bad blood and dirty money that The Knife can twist and expose to exact their revenge.

When your story is complete, you could even use the rich world you've built as a setting for a story in another game, taking place as the dust settles from your explosive finale.

THE DECK

The Slow Knife is inspired by games like For the Queen that are rules-lite enough to eschew a manual, instead teaching the table the rules through a series of cards. This, along with a guided setup process that takes you through the creation of your world and characters, means that you don't have to do any kind of prep going into a game—just open the box and get going.

Here's what you'll find (subject to change!):

- 20 tutorial cards, to teach the rules of the game.
- 1 reference card, because who doesn't love a reminder.
- 13 prelude cards, to establish your setting & characters.
- 4 act cards, to set up and explain the 4 acts.
- 52 prompt cards, split into 4 acts

The cards will be printed in a gloriously large tarot-sized format (2.75" x 4.75") on blue-core cardstock. 'Blue core' is a standard card production technique where a thicker sheet of paper is sandwiched between the printed sheets, which makes them easier to shuffle, opaque and (most importantly) more durable for repeated plays.

But Jack! you cry, You can't just mail me ninety loose cards, you maniac! Oh yeah, there's also a box! A nice two-piece container to keep all your cards safe. Oh, and there's that lovely artwork again—let's talk about that.

This time around we've got the inimitable Rafael Nobre on board for the illustrations. I came across his work when looking at Count of Monte Cristo covers, and as soon as I saw his take I knew he'd be perfect for this project (check it out, it's great!).

His bold use of colour and form is really striking, and I'm really glad he said yes when I reached out.

So, the box has everything you need to play a game of The Slow Knife. But sometimes you don't want to spend an hour of your evening (or more, if your group is anything like mine!) building a world & characters from scratch. So, I'm also writing three playsets that will get you ready to tell your story in minutes, not hours, allowing you to skip the entire prelude set of cards.

THE PLAYSETS

THE COUNT OF SAINT-LAZARE

The first of these is, of course, set in Revolutionary France, 18XX. It's called The Count of Saint-Lazare, the inspiration for which should hopefully be pretty clear at this point! Fans of Alexandre Dumas or Victor Hugo, this one's for you. In the playset you'll get an introduction to the setting, a few quick choices to make as a table about the time period and The Knife, and then you'll choose from four pre-written characters. You'll make a few more quick choices to personalise them, and then get started with your story. 


The Count of Monte Cristo (2002)
The playset will also have useful things like lists of names and locations to help you answer cards as you play. And don't worry if you don't have much historical knowledge of the period—you can engage with it as much or as little as you like, and even choose to introduce magic and other weirdness into your setting if that's your preference. Some people just want to duel with swords in frilly shirts, I get it!

Rafael will be doing the illustrations for this playset too. I'm really excited to see his work printed in riso. Oh yeah! The playset will be riso-printed as a beak zine — just like Bucket of Bolts and Artefact. I love this format because it's small, beautiful and practical, so I'm glad to have found a use for it again. Plus, I had to get some riso in this project somewhere!

You'll go through the booklet part of the zine to learn about and establish your setting and The Knife, then you'll unfold it into an A3 sheet to reveal your pre-made characters and play aids, ready to place next to your board.

But sure, I get it, The Count of Monte Cristo is a big book and a bad film, and period drama might just not be your thing. Don't sweat it. You see, the world of fiction (and the world) is not short of awful rich people. Pretty much every setting you can imagine has enough money-grubbing leeches to tell a thousand stories in The Slow Knife. So here's what I've got planned for the other two playsets:

ARCADIA PRIME
Arcadia Prime is a luxury space station orbiting the terminally-polluted Earth. On it, you'll find a coterie of the ultra-rich and forever young living beautiful, easy lives amongst astonishing technology. Of course, to make the kind of money you need for a ticket to Arcadia, you might need to leave a few loose ends behind you on Earth... If you like hard sci-fi and stories about atrocious mega-corporations, this is the setting for you. This playset will feature illustrations from Torben Bökemeyer, long-time favourite here at Mousehole Press for his stellar (wink) work on Orbital and Bucket of Bolts.

COURT OF ARANDIL
The Court of Arandil is the premier dominion of the high elf elite. Every notable elf aspires to make their way to the moon-touched glades of Arandil, but what they find is far from the lofty place of democracy and learning they are taught about as children. No, this is a cutthroat world of deals, scandal and plots where courtiers vie for the favour of their capricious Queen by any means necessary. Elves can live forever, sure, but they're as vulnerable to a sharp blade in the back as the rest of us... If you like Elrond, but also think he might be kind of a dick, this is the setting for you. This playset will feature illustrations from Hortense Mariano, who I'm really excited to work with. Their expressive character art is going to be great!

Both of these playsets will have the same structure (setting, characters, play aids, etc) as the Count of Saint-Lazare setting, and be printed as beak zines.

Each of the three zines will have its own complementary pairing of coloured paper and riso inks, just like my previous zines. They're going to look great together, and if you pledge for all three I'll stick them all in a fancy foiled envelope for you. Nice one!

DELIVERY

TIMELINES
I've got a draft of the game ready, and I'll be running weekly playtests with willing folks until I'm happy to launch. In the meantime, I'll be liaising with my partner for card printing to get things ready for the final files, so we can hopefully have a fairly straightforward ride towards delivery. I'm hopeful that we'll have everything ready considerably ahead of schedule, but I'm also aware that these projects can easily slip (especially if you're not willing to be that guy with your suppliers). I've also purposely added an arbitrary month to my estimates to avoid shipping chaos in December & dashing hopes of Christmas presents, but fingers crossed we'll be done in 2022.

ACCESSIBILITY
As with previous projects, the digital files will be made available in accessible formats. This will almost certainly involve screen reader-compatible PDFs and plain text versions, but we'll also be investigating options for presenting the prompt cards (which is new for this project).

COMMUNITY COPIES
Every backer of The Slow Knife, physical or digital, will also be contributing one digital copy of the game to be available for free for those who need it. Thanks!

BACKERKIT
As with my previous projects, I’ll be using BackerKit to manage fulfilment. It's what I'm used to and it's really handy for managing all aspects of delivery. I’m collecting shipping fees through Kickstarter so you shouldn’t need to add funds in BackerKit unless you’ve selected add-ons.

TRACKED SHIPPING
To keep costs down, I'm calculating shipping using untracked prices. This means I'll only have proof of postage for your order, not tracking or proof of delivery. If your order goes missing and it's not your fault, I'll send another copy out free of charge. If it's due to an incorrectly entered address or some other similar error, I'll ask that you pay cost price + shipping to send out another copy.

If you'd like to add tracking, you can purchase it as an add-on.

MOUSEHOLE PRESS

Hi, I’m Jack, a tabletop game designer from Southampton, England. I make small, story-driven games, games that you can play in an evening with some friends (or even on your own!).

Over the past couple of years I've taken some of those games to Kickstarter. I launched the Artefact zine for Zinequest 2020, and it did gangbusters, much to my surprise! This gave me the confidence to fund the Orbital zine in August 2020—cementing my love for riso printing and fancy paper. Most recently, I funded Bucket of Bolts for Zinequest 2021, where it once again topped the charts! With Zinequest moving to August this year, I thought I'd take the opportunity to fund a card-based game instead, so here we are. 

And hey, people seem to actually like playing my fancy zines too! As well as loads of lovely comments from players on itch.io, I've had the absolute joy of seeing my work featured by my faves Shut Up & Sit Down and Dicebreaker. But y'know, just generally I really like making nice things?!? That's the main motivation here. And it's only possible thanks to you and your support—so, thanks!

Oh! And it's not just me running Mousehole Press. It's a family gig these days. Rachel, my wife, is my co-pilot for all print and design decisions, and she also does a lot of the branding work. She did all the cool titles on this page too! We'll also be working with all our faves from previous projects for delivery, too! That's Dizzy, Yubi, Chris, etc. The whole gang. Let's go!

RISKS AND CHALLENGES

I've got three big projects successfully delivered now, so I'm pretty happy managing project delivery. There are two big things to raise, though.  Firstly, as with previous projects, this project will primarily be delivered by individuals and small teams. This is great—we support small businesses and friends, and they help us make a better product. However, it also makes us really susceptible to illness and other disruptions, as we don't have a lot of backup options when things go wrong. Outside of something really disruptive, I will always choose to support my fellow creatives and makers rather than look for a last-minute alternative. I am at peace with this trade-off, and I hope you'll understand if things take longer than expected to get delivered.  Secondly, this is the first time I'll be printing part of the game offshore. The cards and box will all be printed in China, as domestic printing wasn't at all viable (costing 6-10x as much). I'm working with a delivery partner for this part of the project, which will hopefully mitigate a lot of the risk, but it's worth raising anyway
